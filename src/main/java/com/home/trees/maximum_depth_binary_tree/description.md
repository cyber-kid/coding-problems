# Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

### Algorithm
Approach: DFS/BFS, recursion

By definition, the maximum depth of a binary tree is the maximum number of steps to reach a leaf node from the root node.
From the definition, an intuitive idea would be to traverse the tree and record the maximum depth during the traversal.
