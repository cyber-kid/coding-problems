Properties:
* Each node has no more than 2 children
* In Each subtree the left node is smaller than a root and right node is bigger than a root
* All items in the left subtree are smaller than the root of the tree
* All items in the right subtree are greater than the root of the tree

A **full binary tree** is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.

A **complete binary tree** is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

ToDo:
Level order traversal (BFS)
Inorder traversal iterative (DFS)
